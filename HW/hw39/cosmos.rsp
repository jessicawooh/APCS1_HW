Episode 1 - "Standing Up in the Milky Way"
@-------------------------------------------------
- Before watching this, I had never learned about the Oort cloud enclosing our solar system. I was surprised to discover that all this time there existed a shell of comets, held together by the gravitational pull of the Sun, around us. 
- In addition to that, there is so much to our world that I was previously unaware of. It’s remarkable how most of our universe appears invisible to our naked eye, but technology implementing infrared radiation allows us to visualize entire planets (like rogue planets). 
- This episode made me feel very small and insignificant (in a calming way). Our existences don’t matter in the grand scheme of things. Our galaxy, the Milky Way, has an entire other galaxy right next to it (Andromeda). In our observable universe, there exists a hundred billion galaxies. And all this is just a bubble in the multiverse! All of the things I stress about on a daily basis (grades, college, etc.) don’t really matter in the grand scheme of things. 
- Words have a lot more power and are capable of making a huge impact on the world even though we might not actively think that. By reading Lucretius’ work, Giordano Bruno was able to conjure up and spread numerous cosmological theories. Lucretius used a metaphor regarding shooting an arrow out into space and if it hits no boundary, then the universe is infinite. This led him to have a dream about a world enclosed in a dome of stars; however, he conquered his fear of the unknown and decided to look past this, discovering that his set of stars was just a few among many other galaxies’. Bruno soon after had an epiphany and connected this to how the power of his God was infinite, therefore the universe had to be infinite. 
- I really liked this quote by Bruno: “The revelation of this immensity was like falling in love"
- Bruno was a rebel. In his world, the Earth was still the center of the universe, and science was not allowed to go against religion. Despite being ridiculed after presenting his thoughts at Oxford, Bruno still pushed for his belief of an infinite universe. He was sentenced to 8 years of prison and torture, but still refused to go against his theories. At the end, he was burned alive for refusing to conform to the church’s beliefs. Years later, Galileo proved that Bruno was indeed right. This shows that you should never abandon your own intuition and vision for someone else’s. 
- Our entire existence was based on chance. Because of an unexpected collision after the Big Bang, our entire solar system formed. It’s remarkable how if the masses missed each other by just an inch, life as we know it would be nonexistent.

Episode 3 - "When Knowledge Conquered Fear"
@-------------------------------------------------
- The best thing humanity had to offer was our intelligence, especially our gift for pattern recognition. We used this gift to read the pattern in the sky.
- Peoples' lives were largely based on what they read from the skies. So when a comet appeared, people had no other logical explanation except that it was a message from god. Most civilizations concluded that it was a bad foreshadowing.
- Our gift in pattern recognition is a double-edged sword. We sometimes deceive ourselves into finding patterns that doesn't exist -- false pattern recognition.
- Where do all the comets come from? Comets can be gravitationally ejected out of the solar system and exiled into space. Yet somehow, the comets still keep coming. Jan Oort concluded that the Oort Cloud -- an enormous swarm of floating preserved remnants and mountains of ice and rocks from the birth of the solar system. Yet, no one's ever seen the Oort Cloud.
- In the Oort Cloud, comets are so far apart that a tiny tug from a planet will pull it away from its trajectory and throw it into a freefall in space. When it reaches our inner solar system, heat from the Sun bakes it, and the melting ice from the comet forms a glowing halo and a tail.
- Humans had no explanation for the apparition of comets except for their guilt and fears.
- Robert Hooke was possibly the most inventive person who ever lived. He discovered the cell through a compound microscope that he invented, improved the telescope, redesigned and rebuilt London after the great fire, derived Hooke's Law, and perfected the air pump.
- Edmond Halley was born curious. Halley drew the first full map of the sky, by which people could navigate by stars visible from anywhere. After publishing the Principia with Newton, he made the first map of the Earth's magnetic field, invented the weather map, laid the groundworks for population statistics, found the actual scale of the solar system, and realized that all stars are moving.
- Coffeehouses in London were places of equality where people shared news and launched ideas. Halley, Hooke, and Christopher Wren met at a house and wondered, "Why do the planets move as they do?" Halley sought out Isaac Newton when they failed to produce results.
- Isaac Newton found refuge in his passion to understand how things worked, especially nature itself. Newton kept to himself while he studied. Newton had already discovered the equation explaining why planets orbit in an elliptical pattern around the sun when Halley proposed his question. Halley asked to him to write his research into a book, but they didn't have money to publish these books of scientific revolution. Halley took it upon himself to see to the printing and publishing of Newton's genius.
- In the past, people looked at the perfection of the clockwards motions of planets in the sky as work of God. Whilst a God-loving man, Isaac Newton looked at the solar system as a whole and wrote laws that applied universally to apples and planets, dispelling the idea that God shaped our world and opening way to more questions. He introduced the idea of space travel. By find the natural laws governing the motions of comets, he severed the motions of the heavens from their ancient connections to our fears.
- Halley set out to discover what comics were and discovered that comets were bound to the Sun in long elliptical orbits. In an age when comets were merely omens of human events, Halley predicted with precision the future appearance of a comet that revolves around the sun, returning to Earth every 74 years.
- Newton's laws allowed for Halley's prophecy, for scientists nowadays to travel to moon, and for us to begin understanding the cosmos.
